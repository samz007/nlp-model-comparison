# NLP-model-comparison

**Overview**

One of the greatest features that AI comes with is Natural Language Processing. Being a form of communication, words used in language has information about feelings involved. The mathematics behind these words in sentences can be used to derive predictions about the feelings of language user.

This repo consist several components that study the natural language processing on various datasets available online. The components are :

* [Review analysis for restaurant review comments](https://github.com/samz007/nlp-model-comparison/tree/master/restaurant_review_analysis)

* [Sentiment analysisys on combined data](https://github.com/samz007/nlp-model-comparison/tree/master/combined_review_analysis)

* [Algorithm designing and Model comparison using Amazon review comments](https://github.com/samz007/nlp-model-comparison/tree/master/review_comment_analysis.ipynb)



**Data**

Dataset for model comaprison can be obtained at [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews). The dataset is available in form of sentences with corresponding lables as test data and training data. Test data is used to evaluate performances of different NLP classifier model
